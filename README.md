EcoTrade is a scalable, microservices-based e-commerce platform built using Java and Spring Boot. It follows best practices of microservices architecture, allowing each service to manage a specific domain like product management, orders, inventory, and payments. This platform is designed to be flexible, fault-tolerant, and ready for cloud deployment.

Message Broker: Kafka/RabbitMQ used for asynchronous communication between services.
Technologies Used
Java 17 with Spring Boot for microservice development.
Spring Cloud for service discovery (Eureka), API Gateway (Zuul/Spring Cloud Gateway), and configuration management.
JWT/OAuth2 for security and user authentication.
Kafka/RabbitMQ for message-driven architecture.
PostgreSQL as the relational database for various services.
Docker for containerizing each microservice.
Kubernetes for managing microservice orchestration and scaling.
Hibernate/JPA for ORM in relational databases.
Maven for dependency management and project build.
